# âš¡ Performance Optimization

## ðŸš€ Multi-threading Parallel Processing
- **Smart Thread Pool**: Automatically adjusts concurrent thread count based on CPU cores (maximum 8 threads)
- **Parallel Conversion**: Multiple components processed simultaneously, significantly reducing batch conversion time
- **Thread Safety**: File operations and symbol library writes use locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity
- **Resource Optimization**: Single components processed directly to avoid unnecessary thread overhead

## ðŸ“Š Performance Improvement Effects
- **Batch Processing**: Dramatically reduced conversion time for multiple components (improvement depends on component count and system configuration)
- **CPU Utilization**: Full utilization of multi-core processor performance
- **User Experience**: Real-time progress display with processing time and parallel status information
- **Smart Scheduling**: Parallelized execution of network requests and file I/O operations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Thread Pool Management**: Implemented using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Locking Mechanism**: Independent locks assigned to each symbol library file to avoid write conflicts
- **Error Isolation**: Single component processing failure does not affect other component conversions
- **Memory Optimization**: Reasonable control of concurrency count, balancing performance and resource usage
